# Overview

Certificate owners can easily access important information such as course name, validity status, and date. This platform offers a transparent and trustworthy way to verify certificates, open to anyone who wants to quickly verify the accuracy of their certificates. Secure and verify your certificates with Certificate Verify DApp!

# Features
+ Explore ongoing certificate verifications.
+ Request certificate verification for your documents.
+ Real-time updates: Receive instant notifications for verification status changes.
+ Ownership Transfer: Easily transfer ownership of verified certificates.
+ Ethereum Wallet Integration: Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for seamless verification processes.

# Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally and start participating in web3 dapp.

## Prerequisites
1.Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/tr)
## Installation
1.Clone the repository:

```  git clone https://github.com/MeryemSulum/Certificate-Verify-Dapp.git ```

2.Navigate to the project directory:

```  cd Certificate-Verify-Dapp ```

3.Install required npm packages:

``` npm install```

## Usage

1.Start the development server:

``` npm start```

2.Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the DApp.
3.Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the DApp.
4.Add certificate information and Learn the validition of certificate.

## Smart Contracts
The smart contracts in this project facilitate the verify process. These contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
